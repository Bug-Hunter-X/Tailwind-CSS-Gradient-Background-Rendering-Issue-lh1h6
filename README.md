# Tailwind CSS Gradient Background Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS gradient backgrounds. The bug manifests as unexpected rendering or behavior, especially within complex or nested layouts. 

The issue occurs because of conflicting styles or an interaction between the gradient and another CSS property that is not properly handled by the Tailwind CSS engine.  This often involves using gradients in combination with other utility classes such as `shadow`, `rounded`, or specific positioning modifiers.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `gradientBug.html` in your web browser.
3. Observe the unexpected rendering behavior of the gradient background.

## Solution

The solution provided in `gradientSolution.js` addresses the bug by carefully adjusting the CSS properties to resolve the style conflicts and ensuring that Tailwind directives correctly apply.
